## Experience

`February 2021 - current`
**Java and AI developer** @ *Ifin Sistemi s.r.l.*

My tasks right now are:
* To develop tests for a Java EE8 application written with Vaadin;
* To develop, improve and integrate an OCR document recognizer.

`September 2020 - December 2020`
**Full stack developer** @ *Primo Round s.r.l.*

Here I worked on my master thesis "An Innovative Approach to NLP Chatbot Training". 
I developed a web application with Angular, Node.js (NestJS) and MongoDB that helps in generating and deploying a chatbot on the Amazon Lex platform.

The following technologies were involved:
* Angular 10 as Frontend SPA framework;
* Node.js with NestJS as Backend framework;
* MongoDB as DBMS;
* Node.js as AWS Lambda environment.

During this experience I had the opportunity to try NestJS and, more importantly, to understand how a chatbots and serverless services (like AWS Lambda) work.

`July 2019 - December 2019`
Review of the paper **A semi-partitioned model for Mixed Criticality Systems (Xu, Burns)**

As an assignment for the university course *Real Time Systems* I had to review the cited paper and to replicate some of the experiments that they presented, in order to verify if their claims were justified.

In particular, beside the written review, I had to measure the cost of migrating a process from a CPU to another. Regarding this, I implemented a simple benchmark as an overlay for *Mininmal Linux* written in C (using Linux kernel libraries).

Skills acquired:
* Understading of how migrating a process works;
* Understading of linux scheduler C libraries.

`January 2018 - August 2020`
**Instant Developer programmer and Artificial Intelligence Researcher** @ *Tepui s.r.l.*

One of my task was to develop applications using the Instant Developer platform, which involved using also Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft IIS. I was also assigned with the responsability of interact with a customer.

Another task I had to do was studying and developing a scheduler (using Python) that helped in the process of allocating jobs to mechanics. The problem was essentially an instance of *FJSP* (*Flexible Job-Shop Problem*) and was solved with a genetic algorithm.

Skills acquired:
* Interaction with customers;
* Understanding of how genetic algorithms work;
* Understanding of FJSP scheduling problem.
 
`June 2018 - October 2018`
**Full stack developer** @ *WebPD s.r.l.*

I worked on my BsC thesis "Analysis, improvement and extension of the functionalities of a cruise Booking Engine", whose subject was the website [crociereregalo.it](https://www.crociereregalo.it). 

First of all, I had to optimize the execution time of some queries on a Microsoft SQL Server database using SQL Server profiling tools.
Moreover, I had to integrate to an existing cruise booking engine three new webservices of cruise companies (Royal Caribbean, Celebrity, Azamara).
In the end I also tweaked a bit the UI of the website using CSS3 and Boostrap.

Tecnologies involved:
* PHP with CodeIgniter;
* HTML5/CSS3/jQuery + Boostrap;
* Microsoft SQL Server.
