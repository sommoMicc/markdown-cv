## About me

I like to call myself a **geek**.

Regarding information technology <i class="fas fa-tv"></i>, I love to try always new things.

I am passionate about web and mobile development, but recently I have also approached the field of artificial intelligence / machine learning.

As a freelance developer I created a few Android and Flutter <i class="fas fa-mobile-alt"></i> apps, even just to try some new technologies.

I have the passion for device modding: I constantly change ROMs on the phone and system operating on the computer. Some of my projects (including drafts) are available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/sommoMicc).

I like to practice outdoor sports like cycling <i class="fas fa-biking"></i>, running <i class="fas fa-running"></i> and kayaking to keep myself fit and healthy.

A typical day invoves the use of:

- React and React Native, with TypeScript
- Next.js, with all possible optimizations (such as SSR)
- Node.js + Express
- AWS services like S3, DynamoDB, Lambda
- RDBMS such as Postgres, with an eye on query performance optimization
- APM and monitoring tools like AWS CloudWatch and Sentry

As developer, I always have to work together with UI/UX designer using Figma. Also, due to the nature of the job, I often have to get in touch with customers and stakeholders in order to collect feedbacks and ideas from them.
