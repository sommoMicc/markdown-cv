## Experience

`February 2021 - current`
**Java and AI developer** @ *Ifin Sistemi s.r.l.*

My tasks right now are:
* To develop tests for a Java EE8 application written with Vaadin;
* To develop, improve and integrate an OCR document recognizer.

`September 2020 - December 2020`
**Full stack developer** @ *Primo Round s.r.l.*

Here I worked on my master thesis "An Innovative Approach to NLP Chatbot Training". 
I developed a web application with Angular, Node.js (NestJS) and MongoDB that helps in generating and deploying a chatbot on the Amazon Lex platform.

The following technologies were involved:
* Angular 10 as Frontend SPA framework;
* Node.js with NestJS as Backend framework;
* MongoDB as DBMS;
* Node.js as AWS Lambda environment.

During this experience I had the opportunity to try NestJS and, more importantly, to understand how a chatbots and serverless services (like AWS Lambda) work. 

`July 2019 - December 2019`
Review of the paper **A semi-partitioned model for Mixed Criticality Systems (Xu, Burns)**

As an assignment for the university course *Real Time Systems* I had to review the cited paper and to replicate some of the experiments that they presented, in order to verify if their claims were justified.

In particular, beside the [written review](media/RTS_project.pdf), I had to measure the cost of migrating a process from a CPU to another. Regarding this, I implemented a simple benchmark as an overlay for *Mininmal Linux* written in C (using Linux kernel libraries). The code is available on [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/sommoMicc/minimal), created starting from a fork of *Minimal Linux Live*.

Skills acquired:
* Understading of how migrating a process works;
* Understading of linux scheduler C libraries.

`January 2018 - August 2020`
**Instant Developer programmer and Artificial Intelligence Researcher** @ *Tepui s.r.l.*

One of my task was to develop applications using the Instant Developer platform, which involved using also Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft IIS. I was also assigned with the responsability of interact with a customer.

Another task I had to do was studying and developing a scheduler (using Python) that helped in the process of allocating jobs to mechanics. The problem was essentially an instance of *FJSP* (*Flexible Job-Shop Problem*) and was solved with a genetic algorithm.

Skills acquired:
* Interaction with customers;
* Understanding of how genetic algorithms work;
* Understanding of FJSP scheduling problem.
 
`June 2018 - October 2018`
**Full stack developer** @ *WebPD s.r.l.*

I worked on my BsC thesis "Analysis, improvement and extension of the functionalities of a cruise Booking Engine", whose subject was the website [crociereregalo.it](https://www.crociereregalo.it). 

First of all, I had to optimize the execution time of some queries on a Microsoft SQL Server database using SQL Server profiling tools.
Moreover, I had to integrate to an existing cruise booking engine three new webservices of cruise companies (Royal Caribbean, Celebrity, Azamara).
In the end I also tweaked a bit the UI of the website using CSS3 and Boostrap.

Tecnologies involved:
* PHP with CodeIgniter;
* HTML5/CSS3/jQuery + Boostrap;
* Microsoft SQL Server.

`November 2017 - June 2018`
**Backend developer** @ *TuTourSelf s.r.l.*

Tecnologies involved:
* Node.js with Express.js
* MongoDB
* JsUnit and Mockgoose
